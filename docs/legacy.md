# Legacy content

This repository previously contained a very large “kitchen sink” tuning guide.

It was removed in this updated version because it included high-risk / low-evidence tactics that can:
- reduce security (e.g., disabling Defender, mitigations)
- break system features or updates
- conflict with anti-cheat (VALORANT/Vanguard)
- add significant maintenance burden

If you are looking for stable, measurable wins, use:
- `README.md`
- `docs/pc1-valorant-profile.md`
- `docs/configure-nvidia.md`
- `docs/registry-opts.md`
- `docs/usb-peripherals.md`
- `docs/valorant-network.md`

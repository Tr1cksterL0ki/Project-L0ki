# Windows Update Strategy (Esports PC)

Goal: stay secure and stable **without** surprise regressions during match days.

## Recommended approach
- Install **monthly security cumulative updates**.
- Avoid **optional Preview (“C-week”) updates** unless they fix a problem you have.
- Before patching:
  - create a restore point
  - ensure you have a rollback plan (system image or at least important data backup)
- After patching:
  - play-test VALORANT for stability (no new stutter/crashes/Vanguard issues)
- If Microsoft lists a known issue for your OS build, check **Windows Release Health** before updating.
